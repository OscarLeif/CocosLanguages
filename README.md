# Multi-Languages-Cocos-2d-x
This is an example of multi language for cocos 2d-x v 3.x
Right now I update the soure files to the version 3.4. I will update this files if there's a new version of cocos2d-x. This is based on this post originaly created by Den, take a look here for the original example.

How to use this sample.

after create a hello world project just replace the files with this ones.

What is new here ?
After complete the tutorial from the cocos 2d-x post IU test it in Android and it works nice, but when I port it to the Windows.32 version it doesn't work well. I just update the call of the headers files, and it work on windows :) -Windows desktop-

Like android here we have some JSON files with our strings or words for each language, in order for create a multilanguage game for cocos 2d-x using this technique we need a JSON file for each language.
