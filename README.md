# Multi Languages Cocos 2d-x
This is an example of multi-language for Cocos 2d-x v 3.x
I update the source files to the version 3.7. I will update this files if there's a new version of cocos2d-x. This is based on this post originally created by Den, take a look here for the original example.

http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/tutorial-multiple-language-support/16237.

In order to use this you must have cocos2d-x V3.7. 

Download the reposotory and just copy and paste the cocos2d folder inside this root project directory.
The cocos2d folder is cocos 2d-x itself.

Support.
